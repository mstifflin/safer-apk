INSTRUCTIONS TO GET A LOCAL TEST SERVER WORKING WITH YOUR APP

1. Make sure that your USB connected phone and laptop are on the same wifi network
  - I haven't tested or tried to get this working on the emulator--someone is welcome to add directions to this as needed 

2. Run your server via the nodemon command from the root/server folder in the safer-server repo

3. Open up System Preferences > Network 

4. Observe the IP address (should look like this)
  - Wi-Fi is connected to Hack Reactor and has the IP address xx.x.xx.xxx.

5. Open up the developer menu while the app is running (shake the phone)

6. Select Dev Settings > Debug server host & port for device

7. Type in the IP address you found from Step 3, WITH PORT OF 8081
  - Example: 10.6.64.195:8081

8. Now, replace the endpoint variable here with your IP address using the port we designated - 1337

9. Whenever you make a fetch request to our server, make sure you're using the endpoint here + whatever route you want

// Please fill and rename this file to endpoint.js
// endpoint.js is included in the gitignore
//export default endpoint = 'http://<your IP address here>:1337'
