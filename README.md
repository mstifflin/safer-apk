## Troubleshooting

- If you get something similar to this error, specifically with 'default' not found:
```sh
A problem occurred configuring project ':app'.
> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':app:_debugApk'.
   > Configuration with name 'default' not found.
```
then you should check your android/settings.gradle file for a node_module that is not installed. All react native modules that are listed there should look something like this:
```sh
project(':react-native-fcm').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-fcm/android')
```
follow the path listed as the last argument to new File and make sure it's installed for every project in settings.gradle.

- If you get an error about naming collisions, similar to this:
```sh
Failed to build DependencyGraph: @providesModule naming collision:
  Duplicate module name: react-native-vector-icons
  Paths: /Users/chandlervdw/Repos/Relay/mobile/node_modules/react-native/local-cli/rnpm/core/test/fixtures/files/package.json collides with /Users/chandlervdw/Repos/Relay/mobile/node_modules/react-native/Libraries/Animated/release/package.json

This error is caused by a @providesModule declaration with the same name accross two different files.

```
Then you need to delete your npm cache inside your home directory:
```sh
rm -rf ~/.npm
```
Then run React Native's packager with the --reset-cache option:
```sh
npm start --reset-cache
```

- If you're not using an emulator, make sure wifi is on and you're connected to the same network.

- Try deleting node_modules and reinstalling:
```sh
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```

- Turn it off and back on again. Turn off your emulator, unplug your phone, close your terminals, and if that doesn't work, restart your computer.
